# pyAnimalTrack

This is the project repository for a group project for COSC591 / COSC391 between David McCormick and Thomas Roberts. Our goal is to create a user interface to streamline the process of preparing and analysing data used for livestock movement.

API Doco can be found here:

This above link also includes auto generated docs for the UI interfaces.

The UI Doco can be found in the Docs/ directory, and includes a user install guide and walk through.
